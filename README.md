<br/><br/>

## Connect:-
Use the Connect_ssh.sh script to simply connect to your dragino gateway.
<br/><br/><br/>


## Connect and save console output:-
Lets say you view something on the console of the gateway, to debug or check data received by it. You can save/log that data for later use by saving it in a new file inside the gateway's storage.  
Use the Console_Output_Save_ssh.sh script to save output of gateway ssh console.
##### Code Description:
_My version for gateway console terminates the current file and creates a new one if size becomes too large._  
- 't' is the time it would keep downloading to text one file.  
- 'x' is the name appended to the name of files.  
- 'format' is the file format.
